# Speech Trainer

## About
This project intends to use computer visuals to help stutterers practice becoming more fluent by observing their breathing and voice and giving feedback about when to "turn their voice on." The latest version requires a Vernier Respiratory Belt and Insignia microphone. 

The inspiration for the interface came from CAFET (Computer-Assisted Fluency Establishment Training), a computer program for clinical treatment of stuttering that was popular in the 90's and that I used myself in the late 2000's.
