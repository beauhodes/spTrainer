# Speech Trainer

## About
This project intends to use computer visuals to help stutterers practice becoming more fluent. The latest version requires a Vernier Respiratory Belt and Insignia microphone. 

The inspiration for the interface came from CAFET (Computer-Assisted Fluency Establishment Training), a computer program for clinical treatment of stuttering that was popular in the 90's and that I used myself in the late 2000's.

## Using the Speech Trainer
#### Hardware
Ensure that both your Vernier Respiratory Belt and Insignia microphone are plugged in and turned on.
